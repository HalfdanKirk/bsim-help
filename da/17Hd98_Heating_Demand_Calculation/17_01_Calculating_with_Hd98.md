# Calculating with Hd98

<div id="gray_background">

From 1. April 2006 it is not allowed to use Hd98 for building permit applications any more.

From 1. January 2006, with a transition period until 31. March 2006, the tool [Be06]() must be used. 

From 1. January 2010 the tool [Be10]() must be used.

The heating requirement for the entire building model can be calculated by clicking the *Hd98* icon (if the program is linked to *BSim*). All the spaces in the model are included in the calculation, which means that constructions have to be defined for **all** faces in the model and **all** windows have to be defined.

When a model is imported into the Hd98 program, information on the building's time constant will be missing. An appropriate thermal capacity therefore has to be chosen. Please also see the Hd98 help for more information on selecting a thermal capacity for a building to be calculated with the Hd98 program.

### **Adding Hd98 as an application**
* The *Hd98* program can be added to the toolbar in *BSim* as described under [*SimDXF*]().
